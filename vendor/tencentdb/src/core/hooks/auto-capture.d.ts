/**
 * auto-capture hook (v3): records conversation messages locally (L0),
 * then notifies the MemoryPipelineManager for L1/L2/L3 scheduling.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - Always write L0 locally via l0-recorder.
 * - When VectorStore + EmbeddingService are available, also write L0 vector index.
 * - Notify MemoryPipelineManager for L1/L2/L3 trigger evaluation.
 * - L1 Runner reads from VectorStore DB (primary) or L0 JSONL files (fallback).
 * - Extraction is NOT triggered here. The pipeline manager decides when.
