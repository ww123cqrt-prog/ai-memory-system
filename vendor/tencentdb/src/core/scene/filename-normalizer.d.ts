/**
 * Scene filename normalizer.
 *
 * Defensive engineering layer that runs *after* the LLM writes scene_blocks/*.md
 * and *before* syncSceneIndex(). Even though the prompt forbids spaces and
 * punctuation in filenames, LLMs occasionally produce names like
 * `Daily Rhythm in Shanghai.md`. Such names break:
 *   - Markdown navigation refs that downstream tools parse with `\S+\.md`
 *     (e.g. health-checker's scene reference detection).
 *   - Shell-based tools that iterate scene files without quoting.
 *   - URL/path encoding consumers (COS object keys etc).
 *
 * This module renames offenders to a canonical form on disk and lets every
 * other consumer (PersonaGenerator, recall, profile-sync) read the already
 * sanitized name from scene_index.json — no additional changes needed.
 */
/**
 * Normalize a single scene filename.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Preserves the `.md` extension (case-insensitive match, lowercased).
 *   - Whitespace runs (spaces / tabs) → single hyphen.
 *   - Strips quotes, brackets, and ASCII punctuation that breaks shell/markdown.
 *   - Collapses consecutive separators (`-`, `_`, `.`).
 *   - Trims leading / trailing separators.
 *   - Falls back to `"scene"` if the stem becomes empty.
 *
 * Allowed character set after normalization (informally):
 *   ASCII alphanumerics, CJK ideographs, hyphen, underscore, dot.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "Daily Rhythm in Shanghai.md"  → "Daily-Rhythm-in-Shanghai.md"
 *   "日常生活 健康管理.md"          → "日常生活-健康管理.md"
 *   "Coffee (Yirgacheffe).md"      → "Coffee-Yirgacheffe.md"
 *   "  spaced  .md"                → "spaced.md"
 *   ".MD"                          → "scene.md"
 *   "已经规范.md"                   → "已经规范.md" (no-op)

 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Non-`.md` files are ignored (the LLM tool surface is restricted to .md,

 *   - Empty / soft-deleted files are not pre-filtered here; the SceneExtractor
