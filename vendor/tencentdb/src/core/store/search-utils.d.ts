 * Each item's RRF score = sum over all lists of 1/(k + rank + 1).
 * Items appearing in multiple lists get their scores summed.

 * @param lists   Array of ranked lists. Each list must have items with an `id` field.
 * @param k       RRF constant (default: 60).
 * @returns       Merged list sorted by descending RRF score, with `rrfScore` attached.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const merged = rrfMerge(
 *   [ftsResults, vecResults],
 *   (item) => item.record_id,
 * );
