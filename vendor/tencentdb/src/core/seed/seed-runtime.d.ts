/**
 * Seed runtime: L0→L1→L2→L3 orchestration for the `seed` command.
 *
 * Uses the shared pipeline-factory for VectorStore/EmbeddingService init,
 * L1 runner, L2 runner, L3 runner, and persister wiring — keeping this
 * module focused on seed-specific concerns:
 * - Synchronous per-round L0 capture with progress reporting
 * - waitForL1Idle polling (L1 only — see FIXME below)
 * - Ctrl+C graceful shutdown
 *
 * FIXME: Currently we only wait for L1 to become idle before destroying the
 * pipeline.  L2 (scene extraction) and L3 (persona generation) may still be
 * in-flight when `pipeline.destroy()` is called.  This is intentional for now
 * to avoid excessively long seed runs, but means seed output may not include
 * the latest L2/L3 artifacts.  Re-evaluate adding a full L1+L2+L3 idle wait
 * once pipeline-manager exposes reliable L2/L3 idle signals.
