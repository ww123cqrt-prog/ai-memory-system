/**
 * L0 Conversation Recorder: records raw conversation messages to local JSONL files.
 *
 * Triggered from agent_end hook. Receives the conversation messages directly from
 * the hook context (no file I/O needed), sanitizes them, filters out noise, and
 * writes to ~/.openclaw/memory-tdai/conversations/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Uses JSONL format (**one message per line** — flat, easy to grep/stream)
 * - One file per day (all sessions merged into the same daily file)
 * - sessionKey is stored as a field in each JSONL line, not in the filename
 * - Independent from system session files — format fully controlled by plugin
 * - Messages are sanitized to remove injected tags (prevent feedback loops)
 * - Short/long/command messages are filtered out
