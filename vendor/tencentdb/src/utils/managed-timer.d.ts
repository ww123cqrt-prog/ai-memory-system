/**
 * ManagedTimer: a named, lifecycle-managed wrapper around setTimeout.
 *
 * Eliminates repetitive clear→set→fire→clean patterns by providing:
 * - `schedule(delayMs, cb)` — cancel any pending timer, set a new one
 * - `scheduleAt(epochMs, cb)` — schedule by absolute time point
 * - `tryAdvanceTo(epochMs, cb)` — only reschedule if new time is *earlier*
 * - `cancel()` — cancel without triggering
 * - `flush()` — trigger immediately (for graceful shutdown)
 * - `pending` — whether a timer is waiting
 *
 * The optional `isDestroyed` guard prevents firing after the owner is torn down.
