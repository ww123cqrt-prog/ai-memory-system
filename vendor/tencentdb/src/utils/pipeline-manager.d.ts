/**
 * MemoryPipelineManager: manages the L0→L1→L2→L3 memory extraction pipeline.
 *
 * ## Layered architecture
 *
 * - **L0 (capture)**: `auto-capture.ts` extracts new messages from each
 *   `agent_end` event, sanitizes them, and passes them to the pipeline via
 *   `notifyConversation(sessionKey, messages)`. Messages are buffered
 *   locally per-session — NO remote call happens at this stage.
 *
 * - **L1 (batch extraction / ingest)**: When the conversation count reaches
 *   `everyNConversations` OR the session goes idle for `l1IdleTimeoutSeconds`,
 *   the L1 Runner is invoked with all buffered messages. The runner receives
 *   `{ sessionKey, msg, bg_msg }` and is responsible for ingesting/extracting
 *   them (e.g. calling appendEvent, or running local extraction logic).
 *   `bg_msg` is reserved for background context; currently always empty.
 *
 * - **L2 (scene extraction)**: Per-session downward-only timer. After each
 *   L2 completion, the next fire time is set to `now + maxInterval`. When
 *   L1 completes (new memory event), the fire time is advanced (but never
 *   postponed) to `max(now + delay, lastL2 + minInterval)`. When the timer
 *   fires, if the session is cold (inactive > `sessionActiveWindowHours`),
 *   the timer is cancelled rather than triggering L2 — it will be re-armed
 *   by the next L1 event.
 *
 * - **L3 (persona generation)**: Global mutex (concurrency=1) + pending flag
 *   dedup. Triggered after L2 completes.
 *
 * ## Timer semantics
 *
 * L1 uses a **resettable timer** (classic idle/debounce): each conversation
 * resets the countdown to `l1IdleTimeoutSeconds`. When the timer fires,
 * buffered messages are flushed through L1.
 *
 * L2 uses a **downward-only timer**: the scheduled fire time can only be
 * moved earlier, never later. This ensures both the maxInterval guarantee
 * and the delay-after-L1 responsiveness, while minInterval acts as a floor.
 *
 * Both timer types are implemented via `ManagedTimer` to eliminate
 * repetitive clear→set→fire→clean boilerplate.
 *
 * ## Trigger paths for L1
 *   A. **Conversation threshold** (primary): when `conversation_count >=
 *      effectiveThreshold` in `notifyConversation()`, L1 is triggered
 *      immediately with all buffered messages. The effective threshold
 *      is influenced by warm-up mode (see below).
 *   B. **Idle timeout** (catch-up): when a session goes idle for
 *      `l1IdleTimeoutSeconds`, L1 fires with whatever messages have
 *      been buffered (below threshold).
 *   C. **Shutdown flush**: on graceful shutdown, all pending buffers
 *      are flushed through L1 then L2.
 *
 * ## Warm-up mode
 *
 * When `enableWarmup` is true (default), new sessions use an exponentially
 * increasing L1 trigger threshold instead of jumping straight to
 * `everyNConversations`. The sequence is: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → ... →
 * everyNConversations. This ensures early conversations are processed
 * quickly (first conversation triggers L1 immediately), while gradually
 * reducing processing frequency as the session matures.
 *
 * The `warmup_threshold` field in PipelineSessionState tracks the current
 * threshold. A value of 0 means warm-up is complete (graduated to
 * steady-state). The threshold doubles after each successful L1 run.
 *
 * ## Trigger paths for L2
 *   A. **Delay-after-L1**: L1 completes → timer advanced to
 *      `max(now + delay, lastL2 + min)` → fires → enqueue L2.
 *   B. **MaxInterval guarantee**: L2 completes → timer set to
 *      `now + maxInterval` → fires → enqueue L2 (if session active).
 *   C. **Shutdown flush**: all pending L2 timers are flushed.
 *
 * All queues use SerialQueue (concurrency=1) for serial execution.
 *
 * ## Design doc
 * See `docs/08-pipeline-refactor-design.md` for full architecture.
