 *   - If the prefix is >= {@link HOOK_POLICY_MIN_VERSION}, `apply = true`.
 *   - If the prefix cannot be parsed (unknown / empty / non-string /
 *     undefined — typical on hosts that don't expose `api.runtime.version`),
 *     `apply = false`.  This is the safe default: old hosts don't have the
 *     gate and don't need patching.
 *
 * NOTE: Very early pre-releases of the MIN version itself (e.g.
 * `2026.4.24-beta.1`) will satisfy the predicate. This is intentional —
 * the field was already recognised in those builds and the usage base is
 * negligible.
