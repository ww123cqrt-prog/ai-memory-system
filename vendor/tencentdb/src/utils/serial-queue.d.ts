/**
 * SerialQueue: a lightweight task queue with concurrency=1.
 *
 * Equivalent to `new PQueue({ concurrency: 1 })` but with zero external
 * dependencies. Supports:
 * - Serial execution (FIFO)
 * - `add(fn)` to enqueue a task (returns the task's result promise)
 * - `onIdle()` to wait until all queued tasks have completed
 * - `pause()` / `start()` to suspend/resume execution
 * - `size` to check pending task count
 * - Optional debug logger for enqueue/dequeue/complete diagnostics
